## Workflow in Detail

Let us proceed chronologically. The paper has just been *conditionally accepted* by the managing author (`ME`) - see the proposed message template in appendix @sec-app.

::: {.callout-note}

If not specifically mentioned, all points in the following document apply to both journals equally, i.e. it is possible to interchange `EJ` with `EctJ`.

:::

## Step 1. Editorial Office: Acquisition of Final Version and Logging

1. After conditional acceptance by the `ME`, `EO` waits on `HT` until the required zip file arrives. See the template for conditional acceptance of `ME` for what the required contents are in @sec-app. (*paper, appendices and checklist*). If contents are missing, cycle back to authors until correct and signed. Having those files on `EE` serves the purpose of having a master version of the accepted paper on record, against which we can check the paper after potentially several rounds of replication checks.
1. After successful arrival of *paper, appendices and checklist* on `EE`, `EO` logs the paper's metadata in our shared googlesheet `SS`, filling all fields as shown in figure @fig-logmetadata (leaving the rest empty). Upon turning blue, the googlesheet will send an automated message to the Data Editor ({{< var de.first >}}) - no further action on behalf of `EO` is required.

![`EO` logs meta data of replication package.](img/step0.png){#fig-logmetadata}

## Step 2. Data Editor ({{< var de.first >}}): Acquisition of package

{{< var de.first >}} receives an automated message that a new paper has arrived which needs to be checked for reproducibility. He creates a new folder inside the shared dropbox folder `EJ-2-submitted-replication-packages` (`EctJ-2-submitted-replication-packages` for `EctJ`) named with the main author's last name and their MS number, and *sends a file request link to the author via email*. In practice, the folder is named like

```
Smith-XXXXXXXX-R1
```

for *round 1*.

As a reminder, the dropbox folder structure is as follows:

```
.
├── EJ-1-key-documents
├── EJ-2-submitted-replication-packages
├── EJ-3-replication-reports
├── EJ-4-background-documents
├── EJ-5-back-office-data-editor
├── EJ-6-good-to-go
└── EJ-7-published-packages
```

*After* successful arrival of the package, {{< var de.first >}} logs `arrival date package` in the `SS`.

## Step 3. Data Editor: Replicator Assigment

The DE picks a replicator by setting the following fields on the spreadsheet:

1. Status: when assigning it to replicators, status should be *A* (for assigned).
1. Checker: pick one of the available replicators
1. Date assigned: the date at which this Replicator Assignment is performed.

After those fields have been entered, the Data Editor section of the spreadsheet turns white, and the replicator's part turns <span style="background-color:green;">green</span>. {{< var de.first >}} usually sends a short email to the replicator indicating that a new paper has been assigned, but it is the job of the replicators to regularly check whether they have papers assigned. This is illustrated in figure @fig-logmeta.

![`DE` logs meta data of replication package.](img/step2.png){#fig-logmeta}


He then leaves a note on `EE` as shown in figure @fig-acqui. Notice that this happens *after the article has been assigned to replicators*!

![Acquisition of Replication Package from `EE` `HT` on behalf of the `DE`. Notice manual addition of comment.](img/step1.png){#fig-acqui}


## Step 4. Replicators

### Replicator Availability

::: {.callout-note}
# Where Do I signal my Availability?

👉 in shared spreadsheet `SS` in tab `Replicator-Availability`

:::

* The replicators declare their *current* availability to handle papers in the corresponding section of the `SS` on tab `Replicator-Availability`, by modifying column `Available to take on today`. The other columns are computed automatically based on the current workload of the replicator, 
in order to help {{< var de.first >}} assigning replicators efficiently. This also allows replicators to be idle if they need to be so.

### Replicator Skills

::: {.callout-note}
# Where Do I signal my Software Skills?

👉 in shared spreadsheet `SS` in tab `Replicator-Skills`

:::

### Replicator Timeline

* As noted above, the day a paper is assigned to a replicator, their section of the google sheet becomes <span style="background-color:green;">green</span>. Five days after the paper has been assigned to the replicator, it automatically turns <span style="background-color:yellow;">yellow</span>, and 10 days after assignment it turns <span style="background-color:red;">red</span>. 
* Our target is for the replicator to **complete any given package within 7 days**. The color scheme is supposed to help replicators manage this deadline, see figure @fig-time.

![Replicator Timing indicator](img/step4.png){#fig-time}

### Replicator Workflow

*Notice that this section is close to identical whether the replicator uses their own machine or the cloud based `nuvolos` system*

1. Navigates to shared `DB` folder `EJ-2-submitted-replication-packages`, and looks for the correct submission number and Author names.
1. From that folder, downloads a copy of entire package to their local drive. Notice that `EJ-2-submitted-replication-packages` is *read-only* on the dropbox, so replicators are **forced** to do their work outside of it.
2. Replicator starts clock.
2. Replicator studies the package. 
    1. This will involve a very close reading of the `README` file. 
    1. It will also involve a quick reading of paper and appendices: 
        1. To get an overview of what the required outputs of the replication package are. This includes all figures, tables and other numerical results.
        1. To carefully check the data citation practice. All datasets need to be cited like any other reference (i.e. like a cited paper). 
    1. Next, follows contained instructions, and tries to reproduce all results in the paper. If the contained instructions are insufficiently precise so that after 60 minutes the replicator has not gained an understanding of how certain results can be reproduced, we abort and go to the next step. This does *not* include actual runtime, which can be significantly longer.
3. Replicator stops clock. (If program requires significant runtime, this is not billed as replicator time.)
3. Fills in reproducibility report, a template for which is stored in shared `DB` at `3. Replication reports`
4. Fills in corresponding section of `SS` with relevant data:
    * Completion date
    * Time spent (in hours. 1.9 hours is 1h 54min): *This information will determine the replicators payment.*
    * Whether the checks were successful or not (Y/N)
    * List the software used. Multiple softwares in comma separated list like `stata,fortran,matlab`. Do not include versions, like `stata 18 (MP2)`.
    * The type of Data Statement that should be published with the paper. This can be one of `A,S,T,P` or the combinations `A;T`, `A;S`, `A;S;T`. The meaning of each is explained in tab *Codes* of `SS`.
5. Replicator turns switch `Status` from *A* (assigned) to *B* (back to DE)

In short, the Replicator fills out the part of the `SS` shown in figure @fig-checkout.

![Replicator fills out spreadsheet after completion of checks.](img/rep-excel.png){#fig-checkout}

### Replicator: Confidential Data Access

Some packages cannot share their data with us, not even in a dedicated folder `4-confidential-data-not-for-publication.zip`. What do we do in this case?

1. If the authors provide instructions on how to obtain *direct* access to the data via some procedure with a data provider, we investigate and try to gain access. This has a time limit of 30 minutes. In other words, if within 30 minutes you have not understood whether you can get access and filled out any required forms, we abort. This clearly removes CASD access for instance, or similar systems where strict vetting of users is necessary.
2. If we cannot gain direct access, we try to get access to the author's computer to perform the replication check there. We can use zoom remote control or teamviewer or any other remote connection technology.
3. Alternatively, the data provider offers third party certification services, and performs the checks for us on their secure data.


### Replicator: Precise Guidelines

This section provides some guidelines for what a replicator should look out for in a package, and things which may be included in their report to the `DE`.

>Any of those conditions not met means that the replicator can comment on it in their report. All conditions go under the common heading *making replication less cumbersome*.

1. The `README` needs to contain _all necessary information_ to reproduce the findings in the paper. It should not be required to read the actual source code in order to find out which part of the code produces with part of the output.
1. The produced output should appear in a clearly designated location, ideally a separate folder called `output`.
1. The produced output should be easy to identify via filename. For example, figure 1 in the paper should correspond to `output/figure1.pdf` in the package.
1. The package *must contain* all primary data sources. This is particularly important for cases like _we downloaded the data from www.xyz.com couple of years ago_. The data might no longer be available at this location, or it may be hard to find.
1. The `README` should contain a clear description of the full data processing pipeline, starting with reading the primary data sources, processing codes and intermediate results, ending in final outputs.
1. The replication package should save produced output to files, and not only display results on screen, because this makes it very cumbersome to find and verify single outputs in the paper.
1. The `README` should contain a clear description of the steps one needs to perform to replicate _each result in the paper/appendix_. A single driver script (for example `master.do` or `run.m`) is convienient, however, the gold standard is a table like the following:

| Output in Paper | Output in Package | Script/Program to execute |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------------- |
| Table 1 | `output/tables/table1.tex` |  `code/table1.do` |
| Figure 1 | `output/plots/figure1.pdf` |  `code/figure1.do` |
| Figure 2 | `output/plots/figure2.pdf` |  `code/figure2.do` |



## Step 5. Data Editor Decision

{{< var de.first >}} reviews the replicator's report, sends a final decision to the authors, including the report, and, if revisions are needed, summarizes the content of the report. If further revisions are needed, {{< var de.first >}} changes the status to “R” (Revision) or “M” (Minor changes), depending on whether the revisions will require sending the package back to the replicators ("R") or not ("M"), and fills the corresponding information on the decision section:

* Date Decision taken
* Decision Code: `A` Accept, `R` Major Revision, `M` Minor revision and short description

## Step 6: Package Resubmissions - `EO` and `DE`

Messages from the `DE` to authors inviting changes to the package and resubmission contain two points:

1. A letter to the Data Editor in pdf format *must be submitted to EE*, clearly addressing all points raised.
2. *After* the letter is successfully received on `EE`, the author will receive a new file request link to submit the revised package.

**Internally**, we follow the same steps as with first time submissions:

1. `EO` logs the return of package upon receiving the letter on `EE` by copying the first 9 cells of the rejected version of the paper, and pasting it at the bottom of the spreadsheet, incrementing the `Round` field by 1, and logging the correct `arrival date EE`, as shown in figure @fig-revision.
2. The `DE` is again alerted automatically and sends the file request link to the authors.

![`EO` logs resubmitted paper](img/step-revision.png){#fig-revision}


The `DE` takes care of logging the fields concerning resubmission date:

* In case a  package is resubmitted for the first time, the date of re-submission will be included to close this entry, and a new entry (*row*) will be created with revision number equal 2. If the re-submission is a minor comment, {{< var de.first >}} changes the Status as described below but do not change the code of the Decision section. If the initial outcome of this iteration is already accept, mark the code as “A”, and introduce the current date also as re-submission date, as in figure @fig-resub.

![Acceptance Decisions of the `DE` upon resubmission.](img/step5.png){#fig-resub}

* If no further revisions are needed, {{< var de.first >}} notifies the authors accordingly and changes the status of the google sheet to "AP" (acceptable package).

![`DE` sets status to *Acceptable Package*](img/step5.5.png)

* Next, the package returns to the `EO` for plagiarism checks and final communications with the authors. After this, `EO` sets the status field to `NT` (meaning ready for publication but **N**ot **T**ransferred yet). At that point, the first section of the google sheet turns <span style="background-color:yellow;">yellow</span>:

![`EO` sets status to *Not Transferred* Status](img/step6.png)

## Step 7. Data Editor: Request `Zenodo` Upload

`DE` sends an email to the authors via `EE` (copying `EO` and {{< var pm.first >}}) with a request to upload the package to the [`EJ` community at Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/ej-replication-repository), as indicated on the [DE's website](https://ejdataeditor.github.io/package). 

`DE` adds an important reminder for the authors in their message:

::: {.callout-warning}
# Important Reminder: No Further Modifications of Replication Package!

It is _very important_ that you do no longer modify the contents of your replication package. This includes adding, removing, or editing contained files and folders. The EJ Data Editor team will compare the digital fingerprint of the files you publish on `zenodo.org` against the fingerprint of the final version of your package, which the Data Editor accepted. Those digital fingerprints need to match.

:::

This reminder is also on the `DE`'s website.

This _digital fingerprint_ is the so-called [`md5sum`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5sum), which can be used to compute a unique _checksum_ of a set of data. This technology is widely used in (open source) software distribution, in order to certify integrity of downloaded software. For example, each `R` package has an associated `md5 checksum`. On `zenodo`, this is displayed as follows:


![](img/md5.png){#fig-md5}

We will compute our version of the `md5` string on the finally accepted version of the replication package, located here in the shared `DB`:

```         

├── EJ-2-submitted-replication-packages
    ├── Lastname-XXXXXXXX-R3
        ├── 3-replication-package.zip
```

The computation of the `md5` on our side is straightfoward. On a Linux command line one would run

``` bash
$ md5sum 3-replication-package.zip

93b6634a97954d6cbfefa56f9dff315e 
```

The string `"93b6634a97954d6cbfefa56f9dff315e"` needs to match the string on zenodo, or the paper will not be released for publication. 

::: {.callout-note}

# Importance of initial folder structure

This only works if the authors created the zip file on their computer, that is, if the archive `3-replication-package.zip` was part of their last submitted package. If, for instance, they submit `3-replication-package` (**no zip!!**), and we create the zip archive for them, the md5 sum **will be different**!

:::

## Step 8. Editorial Office: Return to `ME`

After the EO completes the plagiarism checks, as per agreement with the MEs, the EO makes the final acceptance of the paper (unless the authors have changed the content of the paper during replication checks, in which case it is sent back to the ME for approval before final acceptance). After which it is transferred to Oxford University Press (OUP) for publication by the `EO`. When the file is transferred to OUP, it is marked in the system with a status of “P”, after which the entry turns green:


![Setting of Status to *P* (published) after transfer to the publisher OUP by `EO`](img/step7.png)


## Appendix: Conditional Acceptance Message Template{#sec-app}

Dear Author:

I am pleased to inform you that I have decided to “conditionally accept” your submission, MS XXXXXXX, titled “The Title” for publication in the Economic Journal.
This means that your paper has been accepted for publication on the condition that it passes the applicable checks (reproducibility of results and anti-plagiarism).

[SPACE FOR PERSONAL MESSAGES TO AUTHORS]

Your final submission will be checked with anti-plagiarism software. At this stage, you are required to submit all relevant files for production and replication, accompanying files such as material for the online appendix and any data and data documentation files, as per our replication policy at: [https://academic.oup.com/ej/pages/General_Instructions#data](https://academic.oup.com/ej/pages/General_Instructions#data).

Next, I am asking you to submit the final version of all your files in two consecutive steps: Your paper and any appendices together with a signed checklist via Editorial Express, and your replication package via a file request link directly to our Data Editor (see below).

#### Step 1: Submission of Paper via Editorial Express

On Editorial Express, you should submit a single zip file containing three objects: two directories and one pdf file which you signed, as follows.

1.	`1-paper` : A directory containing all source code needed to compile your paper named in the appropriate way. In particular, please include `MSXXXXXXXX-main-YYYYMMDD.tex` and `MSXXXXXXXX-main-YYYYMMDD.pdf`, as well as all required input files (graphs and tables etc.) - MSXXXXXXXX being your manuscript number, and `YYYYMMDD` standing for the date of final submission in ISO format.
2.	`2-appendix` : Directory containing sources for appendices - if applicable - following the same naming convention as above.
3.	`checklist.pdf` : the signed checklist https://bit.ly/3Qa0HW5 .

In preparing the final version of your paper, please consult the instructions for authors at: https://bit.ly/3ivH38d to make sure your final submission conforms to the journal’s requirements.
For creating manuscripts in LaTex, The Economic Journal strongly recommends the use of its TeX template which is downloadable at: [h9https://bit.ly/3g2YBaB)]

#### Step 2: Submission of Replication Package via file request link

*After* having received your final version of paper and appendices together with the signed checklist on Editorial Express (Step 1 above), our data editor will initiate the replication checks process by sending you a file request link, where you will be able to upload your replication package, as soon as you are ready to do so.

*Before* you start to prepare your replication package, please consult the EJ Data Editor website for comprehensive guidance and step-by-step instructions: [https://ejdataeditor.github.io](https://ejdataeditor.github.io).


#### Further Steps

Once I have received all supporting documents along with confirmation that the paper has passed the appropriate checks, I will formally accept the paper for publication. At which point, the paper can be listed as “forthcoming” and your files will be sent to Oxford University Press for production.
Now is also a good time to update the information on your website about the paper and inform the authors you are, or will be, citing in the paper. It is now in your and our best interest to increase the impact of your paper as much as possible.

Thank you very much for your contribution to the Economic Journal. I look forward to seeing it in print.

Sincerely,

Your Managing Editor
