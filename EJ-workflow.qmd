## Purpose of this document

This document describes the current workflow for reproducibility checks at EJ.

**Input:** Replication package provided by the authors of accepted papers. 

**Outputs:** 

1. Email interactions with the authors during the process (via Editorial Express, EE), 
2. clearance with authors after the checks are successfully completed (via EE), 
3. metadata collection on each article at the shared Excel sheet (via Google Docs).

**Interested Parties:**

1. EJ Data Editor: {{< var de.full >}}
2. EJ Editorial Office: {{< var eo >}}
3. Replicators


## Workflow in Detail

We proceed chronologically. The paper has just been *conditionally accepted* by the managing author.

### 1. Editorial Office: Author communication

1. After conditional acceptance by the Managing Editor, {{< var eo >}} communicates with the authors of the paper, sending them instructions about how to produce the replication package and the check-list that authors should submit.
1. {{< var eo >}} also refers the authors to the Data Editor's website at [{{< var de.website >}}]({{< var de.website >}}) for detailed instructions on how to prepare and upload the package.

### 2. Data Editor ({{< var de.first >}}): Acquisition of package

When the authors (re-)submit the package via EE, {{< var de.first >}} sees and downloads the paper from EE’s Holding Tank (HT). The HT includes 

1. initial submissions, 
2. revisions, and 
3. conditionally accepted articles. 

{{< var eo >}} handles the first two types, {{< var de.first >}} downloads the third type, and leaves  a note *after the article has been assigned to replicators*:

### 3. Data Editor: Logging of Metadata

{{< var de.first >}} creates a new entry (*a new row*) in the shared Excel (always open with Google Docs!) including all the relevant meta-data for the article, and assigning it to a replicator:

The relevant columns to be filled by {{< var de.first >}} include:

1. `MS`: Manuscript number
1. `R`: Current round of the reproducibility checks (1,2,3,...)
1. Author, Title, Email from the authors, ME’s initials, Data Policy
1. Arrival date: the date at which paper arrive in HT (Feb 16 in the example above).
1. Status: when assigning it to replicators, status should be “A” (for assigned).
1. Checker: pick one of the available replicators
1. Date assigned: the date in which Replicator Assignment is performed.

After those fields have been entered, the Data Editor section of the spreadsheet turns white, and the replicator's part becomes green. {{< var de.first >}} usually sends a short email to the replicator indicating that a new paper has been assigned, but it is the job of the replicators to regularly check whether they have papers assigned.
